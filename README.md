Create a coding quiz in JS with specific features.
I created 4 html files one for the intro page one for the game one for the end phase and one for the highscore.
I created a tracking bar for each question answered as well as timer that decreases exponentially with incorrect answers.
Correct answers turn the selction green while incorrect answers turn red.Each answer is worth 25 points. At the end you may enter your name and see how you rank.
